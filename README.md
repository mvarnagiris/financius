##Quick links

- [Report an issue or  request a feature][4] but before **[read this](#report-a-bug-or-request-a-feature)**

##Future plans
I plan to add paid features to the app. Everything that is in the app as of v0.9.x will be free, but some (or maybe all)
features will be under in app purchase. The price and model is still TBD.

##Report a bug or request a feature
Before creating a new issue please make sure that same or similar issue is not already created by checking 
[open issues][5] and [closed issues][6] *(please not that there might be multiple pages)*. If your issue is already 
there, don't create a new one, but leave a comment under already existing one.

Checklist for creating issues:

- Keep titles short but descriptive.
- For feature requests leave a clear description about the feature with examples where appropriate.
- For bug reports leave as much information as possible about your device, android version, etc.
- For bug reports also write steps to reproduce the issue.

##Contribute
I do accept and review Pull Requests on **dev** branch. So if you want to contribute, you are very welcome to do so.
